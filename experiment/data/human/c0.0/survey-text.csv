There was an issue with the one instruction page teaching about the node inspector and making you reveal three before moving on. I got stuck on that page briefly because the third node did not reveal but I had pushed an arrow key, so it said I could not move before choosing 3 but there was no other way to go on. So,I had to close and reopen the window to go through the tutorial to do that page just to progress through the rest of the HIT.""}",,373427,,,,930057,,survey-text,1
