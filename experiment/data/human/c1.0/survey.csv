0,Where the negatives congregated,Started with the surrounding three then moved on  from there,left button,Once I felt i had a chance to make money,Nothing,,,
1,Avoided the negative number I clicked on before moving,Just guessed,At the end of a line,I only clicked once.,No.  No strategy just guessing,39,Nope.  Very easy,
2,"If I got a negative 10, I ignored the trail and went elsewhere.","Deductive reasoning, and odds. If I got a positive 10, I followed the trail.",The direction that hadn't been profitable in the past round or two.,"When I was having too much difficulty getting the nodes to reveal themselves. They are very touchy as to where exactly you can click, which led to me wasting time and losing money.","No, nothing else comes to mind. It was fun!",27,"Yes, it said in the instructions that you had a minimum of 7 seconds, I believe, to complete each task. It was more like a maximum of 7 seconds though.",No.
3,I attempted not to explore paths into negative earnings.,I started with the first nodes and expanded based on where I found the highest positive value.,I clicked on the innermost nodes first.,I stopped when I found the best path or one that was good enough.,No,42,No,Thanks.  This was fun.
4,After seeing a negative I tried to go in a different direction.,I tried strategizing ,I kept trying to start with the right side.,When my money was running low.,I figured if I go from right to left that it would work but It really didn't.,47,Nothing was hard to understand.,Thank you for allowing me to be apart of your study.
5,"If a route had a negative number, I would not click on the route unless it appeared to be the lowest. ",I went based off of which node would make the biggest decision. If I clicked a 10 I immediately clicked to another node. ,All of the second nodes.,The second I had 10's or 5's. I felt better taking some decent gains rather than wasting money around other paths.,"Most of my strategy was to start in the second node to determine which path had the best option. I usually had the best chances clicking on the third nodes after the second had been clicked, wasting less clicks.",,,
6,The numbers I was seeing,I figured out that I could start in the middle and do the outside value to see how risky that move would be.,Around the center of the beginning position,If I was in the negative.,Went with my gut for the most part,23,No,I really enjoyed this
7,if the nodes start off as negative,if the first node was positive,the first three nodes,i look at the first node and the end node. if the second one is negative i don't go,the first nodes and the last nodes are the most important in deciding where i go,22,no,
8,The tiles between the beginning ones and the destination.,The last destination.,The outermost tiles.,When there was a clear path to more money.,"I started by clicking closer, but I determined there was sort of a pattern. It didn't help too much. ",45,No,Almost like a route optimization problem.
9,I was not concerned with the ending circles or the first ones as u dont have a general idea of whats going to happen in between. ,"I usually picked the second square to every side so I can get an outlook of the values later, lose first gain later. ",I would click on the middle circles to each side to get a general idea of what happens after the first circle so even if I lost money in first circle I would gain later.,That depended on how much money I lost or gained in the previous round. ,N/A,23,No.,N/A
10,if all three first dots were minus,"first dot then highest amount, never  second dot",,most $,,,,
11,I tried to avoid paths with more negative outcomes in terms of reward,I tried to choose paths which offered the highest reward,The three nodes adjacent to the initial starting point,When I felt satisfied with the reward amount,,,,
12,I made no decisions to click.,I decided not to clock.,I did not click.,I made no clicks.,I relied on randomness.,27,No,
13,"I never clicked after the first set of nodes, just took a chance.",I clicked on one of the first three nodes.  I went to direction of the positive.,the first set of nodes,Only clicked the first set of nodes.,"That is all.  Just clicked the first set of nodes, and took a shot in the dark for the next set.",41,No,This was fun.
14,based on the rules,based on the rules,first three spots,based on the rules,nope.,23,no,
15,If I'd just lost a lot of money on the last turn I didn't click.,I varied where I clicked from turn to turn. ,It depended on what happened in the last round.,If I found two negative spaces I didn't click again.,"Not really. I don't think I had a good strategy. It all seemed pretty random, because I couldn't figure out a pattern. That either means there wasn't one, or I was just bad at it.",43,No.,
16,I guessed,I guessed,I didnt click,I felt like it wasnt worth it,no,20,No,"no
"
17,Avoid circles that came after negative values.,Click the closest circle first then follow the positive values.,The circle directly to the left.,When I found a path with two green circles.,Weighing risk against reward,24,No,Nope
18,random,random,it culd be anywhere,instinct,it was as random as I could mske it,61,no,thank you
19,I did not click on nodes that did not have a revealed path.,"I started at a near node. I the node was green I continued in that direction. If the node was red, I tried a different direction.",One of the three nodes nearest to that start. I don't think I had a preference between any of them.,"I stopped clicking as soon as I found an acceptable path, sometimes settling for the least bad option to avoid clicking away all my money.","No, I think I've covered it.",,,
20,"If I already found a path that was profitable, I would stop.  Also, if a path was shown to be less profitable than one that had already been reveled, I would stop clicking the path",I tried to find the most profitable pat,One of the circles next to the starting point,"If I found a profitable path, at that point I would stop clicking and take the path",,38,No,
21,"I only clicked the end ones, and tried not to click the inner ones.",I clicked the outer nodes looking for the 10,I usually clicked the Left lower node first,"If I found the 10, I stopped clicking",That's it.,41,Not hard at all,This was kind of fun
22,I generally stayed to the left and right,I tried to stay to the left and right,The left and right of the spiders initial position,When i saw a path that made sense,,30,The instructions were very clear,
23,I was put off when I saw negative value on a node next to the starting node and I would generally avoid that path. If I had two positive values shown on the path I would not click more because I felt I would come out ahead or even. ,I always clicked on the dots next to the spider to see if I would start in positive values.  If I had negative results I would click more to try and find a positive or zero sum path. ,The three nodes next to the spider's starting position.,"When I felt I was seeing a green pathway, although sometimes I would hit red at the end and wish I had clicked more. I don't know if I had a consistent pattern but sometimes I felt like I was wasting money some rounds with excessive clicks.","I was trying to follow green paths, especially if ten dollars was the first node. Sometimes I wished I had not as the rest of the path was red. I felt like the dollar was not a huge penalty so sometimes I would click more nodes if I felt I did not have positive values to start. ",,,
24,If I got a negative,By choosing my first move,the first circle,After the first move,nope,28,nope,Very fun!
25,The beginning dots were least likely to provide hints on the paths,The ending dots were the biggest giveaways.,Bottom right or top right.,When the money spent started to climb up. ,Not really. It was mostly a random guess and check.,,,
26,"If the number was negative I went another direction. I decided that the second node from the start wasn't as important as the 1st and 3rd node. I knew the amount had to be -10, -5, 5, or 5.",I clicked on the first nodes from the starting point. Then if the number was positive I clicked on one of the following corners. ,1st node from the start. Direction didn't matter.,If the total amount was positive or if I felt the risk wasn't worth it.,Just worked on keeping the amount positive.,,,
27,spent enough to see where i would lose money,spent enough to either see where i could make money or to minimize loss for round,if i see some green worth 10 or 15 dollars i'd usually click around there.,when i knew enough to i was confident i wouldn't lose money,no.,29,nothing.,
28,when it seemed i was down and out anyways,deciding value vs risk of just betting,yes,when profit seemed imminent ,explore basic options then expand to best outcome possible ,,,
29,I don't really know if I thought about where not to click?,"Generally I would start with the top circle, and then if it was green I'd click the end nodes to find which was green. If the first node was red I'd move around to the other first nodes and see if one was green.",The top node.,By how much money I'd spent on click and how much info I had gained.,Really it was just looking for the first green number in a node then looking for green at the ends.,,,
30,I did not click any further on paths that had a bad start.,I first clicked the start to each path to determine which would be the best to follow up on.,Probably the right.,"If I could determine what was likely the best route, I would stop clicking.","Generally, picking the best first and last spot in the route. The middle spot would be the same, so not worth a click.",37,No,
31,I didn't click any nodes that weren't entry nodes,"I clicked all the ""entry nodes"" to see which direction was optimal",Any entry node,When I found the most optimal entry point to the web cash (positive 5 or 10),,30,No,
32,I didn't bother with any of the branches that began with a -10.,"I tried to avoid initially losing $10 on the first move, then checked to see which of the final branches was better. If one the final branch was $10, I didn't bother to check the other one.","One of the closest circles. Usually the top one, just because I felt like it.",I stopped clicking once I had a viable path to a non-negative outcome.,It was focused on avoiding super-bad outcomes rather than exploring everywhere for the chance of getting a super-good one.,34,I wasn't aware I was only playing practice rounds in the beginning until they were almost over and I was informed that they were practice.,Cute spider.
33,"If there was too much red on a path, I wouldn't click there any more.",I clicked until I found a path with more green than red.,I clicked at the points where I could immediately move from my current point.,I decided to stop clicking when I found a profitable path.,No.,,,
34,guesseed,Guessed,,when the system would not respond,no,76,no,Thanks
35,carefully.,just tryed click differnt ones every time,same one as i did in last game.,when game was over i had too.,no,56,no it was east to understand,
36,usually did not pick the end,usually picked a junction,top middle,when I wasted too much,mostly guessed,,,
37,I only clicked where I thought the information was needed,It was sort of random,In the nodes surrounding the spider,When I felt I had the best path to follow,I just went where I saw the most green.,35,No,
38,I decided not to click if they there were to negatives in a row.,I tried clicking on the end nodes to see if they were negative or postive.,Either on a end node or right next to the spider.,I decided to stop clicking if I got at least 5 points ahead.,I just tried to stay in the positive range.,,,
39,when there was more than one negative number.,"Sometimes based on the rewards in previous nodes. then, based on which had the highest number at the start node.",On the right node.,when I thought the clicks would take away all possible winnings.,I think it was all covered by the questions asked.,,,
40,if I noticed 2 nodes with red numbers in on area i would consider it a bust,"i used the corners of the finishing nodes, and sometimes the first move. ",the corner nodes of the areas and usually the first move.,when I found a path that I thought would end a positive result. I went with that path,"if I found a path that would end positive number, I stopped checking the nodes and went with that path",36,nonr,fun
41,based on negative number,I just ooked at it,the middle ,I didn't,none,27,Nope,
42,I chose based on instinct and instruction from my instincts.,I chose based on my best interest.,Left,I based it on my instinct.,I clicked where most appropriate.,,,
43,I didn't click where I saw a negative mark on the first three bubbles closest to me.,"I clicked the three bubbles that were closest to where I was. From there, I guessed which one would be the best route for the most money.",the first three bubbles surrounding me,When I figured it was the most money I would get. ,"yes, although I admit it's hard to describe this in just this text box. But I tried to find which route would give me the most money, so by selecting the three bubbles surrounding me, I had an idea of where the most money would be. I carefully selected the nodes that would give me enough answers without being too much.",,,
44,n/a,i guessed,n/a,n/a,n/a,22,no,no
45,I didn't click on a negative 10 node,I guessed based on the amount of the first node,on the node which represented the highest value,when i reached the end of the line.,Not being able to see the information needed to make good decisions it was all based on luck,51,no,
46,"After finding positive, I tried not to click too often.",I just guessed after checking for positive money.,Any of the three directions seemed fine.  I had no preference. ,When I felt the risk was greater than the reward.,no,42,no,
47,I guessed a lot and tried to find patterns,Luck and a bit of hints,right,After a couple of bucks,I didn't have much of a strategy,29,I think the directions could have been simpler and had more information spelled out.,
48,just went the other route,I decided just on instinct,to the left or right,when i couldn't anymore,no,32,no,no
49,if there were 2 nodes with 10 bucks I was done clicking the arms,I did the first node on each arm,node to the right,if there were 2 nodes with 10 bucks I was done clicking the arms,i was just hoping to make some money each round,,,
50,If I had enough information to make a good guess.It felt redundant,"Where I would get the most information, the middle ones first.",The middle of the top row.,If I had enough information to make a good guess.,no,,,
51,Tried to avoid -10 tiles right off the bat and tried to avoid what had led to bad outcomes previously,Used my memory of what had led to good outcomes previously,Wherever I thought the +10 tile was ,When I had enough information to know what path I wanted to take,no,,,
52,"I chose some clicks randomly. When I found a green/addition, I did not need to click another circle.","I chose my first click randomly. If I had a red/negative number, I clicked a second time at times, to ensure I would have surplus.","I truly picked randomly, however I noticed I didn't go ""up"" very much.","It said that you can only click on the first node, so I wouldn't click after that of course. However, I did try two first nodes on multiple occasions. By then, I had 2/3 answers, so it helped narrow down my path.","I didn't have one, I just had fun with it!",25,"No, it was very easy.",Thank for for the survey opportunity. Awesome bonus!
53,"If the middle node turned out to be a negative number, I avoided clicking anything nearby unless all the middle nodes were negative numbers.","After a bit of trial and error, I figured that the best place to start was the center of the nodes. That was the fastest way to determine whether the node was a go or no go.",The middle node of any intersection,As soon as I saw a path that did not leave me with negative earning.,Check to see if the middle node is positive and then check to see which path from that positive node led to positive earnings.,,,
54,If there was a negative path.,Guessed it was random...,yes,after 2 or 3 is the most I would spend,It wasnt much strategy it was random there was no path that showed patterns.,36,no,n/a
55,I did not click on the middle nodes until I knew the value of the end nodes.,I decided where to click by checking the value of the end nodes to find the most valuable nodes.,I was most likely to click on the end nodes at the beginning of each round.,I decided to stop clicking when I felt I had found the maximum value nodes in the least amount of clicks.,I tried to determine if some of the end nodes were more likely than others to be a high value node.,,,
56,I did not move to the negative numbers,I went with whatever didn't show up as a negative number,up,When I was losing money,,41,nope,that was fun
57,"If I was already satisfied with the node I clicked on (ie $10), then I decided not to click on any others.","I just randomly clicked and if the first node I clicked on was 10, I generally stopped clicking and accepted that gain.","I think I was fairly evenly clicking on any of the 3 options, I had no system or desire to click on any one more than the other.",If I was satisfied with my first click.,"I mostly just wanted to maximize my bonus, so if I was satisfied with the gain on a round, I stopped and moved on instead of risking it more.",30,"Nope, was all straightforward and easy to understand.",No further comments.
58,just guessed,i checked as much as possible first,to the left,when i couldnt any more,just winged it mostly ,,,
