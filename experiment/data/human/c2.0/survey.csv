1,I didn't bother clicking on the pathways I knew I wasn't going to go.,I always started by looking for the 48 spots. I realized in some situations you don't need to click them all because each run will always have 48 spot.,Always at the end spots and work your way backwards from there.,Once you realize the optimal strategy to gaining the most money it's important to stop clicking.,"So my idea was, I knew there was always going to be a green 48 spot which I always wanted to go for. When you had two green 48 spots, generally, it's best to reveal both pathways and figure out which will gain you more money. This is because you are only losing 4 dollars to reveal those spaces. In general, spending money is really valuable in this game. But in some situations you do not to spend very much and you can decide what is there from deduction.  ",23,no,
2,The ones at the inside were not important.,The ones at the edges are the most important ones. As soon as I find the one with 48 dollars I use that path.,The right top one.,I stop clicking as soon as I find the one with 48 dollars.,Not really.,23,No.,No.
3,I rarely clicked the circles closest to me because they didn't pay as much.,I clicked on the farthest ends to see where the bigger payouts were located.,I was most likely to click at the outermost ends first.,I stopped clicking when I found a circle that paid 45 points.,I just tried to find the highest paying path.,,,
4,if there was a red,based on my preferences,at the edges,if i found the highest number,i wanted the highest at all times,35,no,n/a
