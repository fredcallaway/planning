,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
0,The lowest number,i used the $1 to look ,the frist circles,after 3,that's it. ,27,no,cheers
1,anything outside the first step wasnt worth the click to me,i clicked the first step til i found a postive one or if all negative i ended up clicking on all 3,same throughout,after i found what first step i was taking,that is about all of it,39,no,
2,The first and second nodes don't really matter,"the most I could lose before reaching the final point is $12 so if I even fine one location worth $24, it would be a positive gain so I clicked on the last nodes.",just at the end nodes,I just stopped at an arbitrary 4 clicks.,No,22,No,
3,Once I got a positive I went that way,Tried to just look at the first circle until I found a positive and then follow a path,one of the first circles,Once I found a positive,I started realizing this was severely underpaid by about round 15 and only have 200 points and stopped clicking and just tried pathways with no clicking to complete the experiment. ,33,No,This is severely underpaid for the time it takes and the likelihood of winning a large bonus seemed highly unlikely. I had many all negative pathways.
