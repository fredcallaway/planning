When you had two green 48 spots, generally, it's best to reveal both pathways and figure out which will gain you more money. This is because you are only losing 4 dollars to reveal those spaces. In general, spending money is really valuable in this game. But in some situations you do not to spend very much and you can decide what is there from deduction.  ""}",215372,1552450
