@incollection{Hay2012,
abstract = {Sequential decision problems are often approximately solvable by simulating
      possible future action sequences. \{$\backslash$em Metalevel\} decision procedures have been
      developed for selecting \{$\backslash$em which\} action sequences to simulate, based on
      estimating the expected improvement in decision quality that would result from
      any particular simulation; an example is the recent work on using bandit
      algorithms to control Monte Carlo tree search in the game of Go. In this paper
      we develop a theoretical basis for metalevel decisions in the statistical
      framework of Bayesian \{$\backslash$em selection problems\}, arguing (as others have done)
      that this is more appropriate than the bandit framework. We derive a number of
      basic results applicable to Monte Carlo selection problems, including the first
      finite sampling bounds for optimal policies in certain cases; we also provide a
      simple counterexample to the intuitive conjecture that an optimal policy will
      necessarily reach a decision in all cases. We then derive heuristic
      approximations in both Bayesian and distribution-free settings and demonstrate
      their superiority to bandit-based heuristics in one-shot decision problems and
      in Go.},
